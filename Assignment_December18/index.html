        <strong>Deepest Condolences </strong>I own no more than a iPhone 3 and
        an old iPod, but the greatness I see in the products and the revolution
        it had made in the industry is really astonishing. Death of Steve Jobs
        has created a great vacuum and is very difficult to fill. My deepest
        condolences for his family, for his friends in Apple and millions other
        like me. Anonymous

        <strong>God Bless Steve Jobs</strong> As an artist, designer, art
        teacher, and utilizer of the creative process I have since the beginning
        of this thing called 'Apple' been hooked. There has been no other way.
        And there will be no other way. Let us honor Steve Jobs and keep it that
        way. My condolences to the Jobs Family. Jeff from New York
